Two versions of patches here:

"basic" contains just the basics to fully enable the hardware + luci. Support
for block storage and serial on USB

"full" contains a more robust configuration with samba, ftp and a few others.
This one is compatible with the luci backup available in the sample_configs
folder.

I suggest using the "basic" and then adding whatever packages you desire.
